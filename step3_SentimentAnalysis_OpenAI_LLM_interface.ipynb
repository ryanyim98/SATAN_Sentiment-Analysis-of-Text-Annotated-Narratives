        "\n",
        "Large language models are here to stay and many people have done interesting experiments exploring them and how they seem to capture aspects of human cognition.  In Psych 209-W23 the readings and lecture on Wed Feb 15 will cover some examples of this.  The purpose of this Colab is to give you tools to explore these models.  We provide it because we see several ways these tools could be extended to perform interesting experiments, including possible class projects!\n",
        "\n",
        "One tool allows you to present a prompt to one of the variants of GPT3, and then to assess its prediction for the next word following the prompt.  Inspired be a recent talk by Richard Futrell at UC Irvine (formerly a Stanford undergrad and master's student!) and based on some code he provided, we allow you to present a prompt, and get back the language model's top 5 choices for the next word, as well as the log of the probability it estimates for each choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "We use examples from Richard's talk for this: Given 'The children went outside to' as the prompt.  Here the probability of 'play' is very high, but with a second prompt 'The children went inside to' the probability of 'play' goes way down, and the probabilities of some other alternatives go up.  There are a huge number of questions you can explore, including some of the ones covered in the Dasgupta, Lampinen *et al* paper listed as a reading for Feb 13, starting from this tool and adapting it in various ways!\n",
        "\n",
        "The second tool allows you to present a prompt and see how the model continues from there.  In the second case, the model *samples* words according to it's estimates of their probabilities.  For example with the first prompt above, 'play' is likely to be chosen by this process.  The model then feeds its choice in as the first word of the completion, and then repeats the process.  You can tell it the maximum number of words to sample and also you can tell it to stop if it ever hits one of a set of specified stop sequences, such as '.' or '!', which are common end-of-sentence markers.  So following the first prompt mentioned before, 'play' would likely be the next word, but the output may vary over the 10 runs from there.  \n",
        "\n",
        "NOTE: We are using the Openai *Completions* endpoint.  There are parameters that you can control that affect the sampling process, and you can read more about them in the [Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create) from the Open AI web site.\n",
